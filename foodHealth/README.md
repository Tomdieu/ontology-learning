# Food and Health Ontology

## Overview

This ontology models the relationship between food consumption and health outcomes. It enables the representation of individuals, the foods they consume, and the health problems they experience, with the aim of exploring potential correlations. 

**Note:**  This ontology currently reflects observed associations between food consumption and health problems. It does not infer or establish causal relationships. Further medical analysis and domain expertise are required to determine causation.

## Namespace

The ontology uses the following base namespace: 

* `http://example.com/food-health#` (You should replace this with your actual namespace)

## Ontology Classes

* **Person:** Represents an individual.
* **Food:** Represents a type of food consumed.
* **HealthProblem:**  Represents a health problem or condition.

## Ontology Properties

* **eats:** Connects a `Person` to a `Food` they have consumed. 
   - Domain: `Person`
   - Range: `Food`
* **experiences:** Connects a `Person` to a `HealthProblem` they have encountered.
   - Domain: `Person`
   - Range: `HealthProblem`

## Files

* **foodHealth.owl:** OWL version of the ontology.
* **foodHealth.ttl:** Turtle representation of the ontology.

## Future Work

* Incorporate more specific food and health problem classes for detailed analysis.
* Integrate external knowledge sources (e.g., medical databases) to enhance the ontology with established causal relationships.
